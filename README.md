# Sumory Bears

Gummy-bear based variation of the Sumory exhibit.

The Sumory exhibit, part of the I AM AI exhibition, is a way to teach the concepts of 
exploration and exploitation.

## Building

Requires Node.js (v18.19 or greater) and npm.

To build the project, run:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory, and can be served using any web server.

## Query strings

The `index.html` accepts the following query string parameters:

- `settings`: The name of a settings file to load. Defaults to `settings.yml`. It must reside in the
  root directory and have a name that only contains letters, numbers, - or _, and ends in `.yml`.
- `sentry-dsn`: Sentry DSN to use for error reporting. Defaults to none.

## Configuration

The configuration files are in the `config` directory.

You can override any of the configuration keys through a `settings.yml` file in the root directory.

The `app.config.json` file in the root directory contains build-time configuration settings.
